لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ ٱللَّٰهِ
"There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad (PBUH) is the messenger of Allah."

##SALAH is the first thing you will be questioned about,
so donot make it the last thing on your mind.##

**He said, I only complain of my suffering and my grief to Allah, and 
I know from Allah that which you do not know.**[Qur’an 12:86]

##And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and
lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient.##[Qur’an 2:155]

#*So whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer – no denial will 
there be for his effort, and indeed We, of it, are recorders.*#[Qur’an 21:94]
